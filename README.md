# API-Coding-Quiz
## Create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz

I was asked to create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
* Questions contain buttons for each answer.
* When answer is clicked, the next question appears
* If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. 
* When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.

I wanted to further my knowledge of Javascript and API's by creating a quiz. My motivation was to improve my confidence through practice. I became more confident in DOM's, local storage and creating and pausing timers.


## Usage

link to my deployed project: 


* Press the 'Start Quiz' button to start the quiz. 

* The timer will start and time will be deducted by 10 seconds for every incorrect answer.

* Once the game ends, please enter your initials to be added to the high scores list. 

* You will then be taken to the high score list where you can see your results.
