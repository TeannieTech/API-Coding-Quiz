# API-Coding-Quiz
## Create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz

I was asked to create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. 

* When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.

I wanted to further my knowledge of Javascript and API's by creating a quiz. My motivation was to improve my confidence through practice. I became more confident in DOM's, local storage and timers.


## Usage

* Press the start button to start the quiz. 
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

* The timer will start and will be deducted by 10 seconds for every incorrect answer.

* Once the game ends, please enter your initials to be added to the high scores list. 

* You will then be taken to the high score list where you can see your results.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
